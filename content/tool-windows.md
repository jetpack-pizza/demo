# Working with Tool Windows
IntelliJ IDEA offers Flutter- and Dart-specific tool windows that help to control the development process. Widgets are the core building blocks in Flutter (everything-is-a-widget concept), so the Flutter and Dart plugins provide developers with tools for visualizing and exploring widget trees, managing widgets, and ensuring the structure correctness. Flutter runs on Dart, and the code analysis is performed automatically, displaying the messages in a special tool window.

## Flutter Outline Tool Window
The **Flutter Outline** tool window helps to work with Flutter widgets and shows your project's widget hierarchy, so you can see the actual association between parent and child widgets, check the structure, and modify it. To open the tool, click **Flutter Outline** on the right side of the main IDE window. Alternatively, you can choose **View | Tool Windows | Flutter Outline** on the main menu.

## Flutter Inspector Tool Window
The **Flutter Inspector** is a tool for visualizing and exploring widget trees and debugging Flutter UI. It also helps to manage bidirectional mapping between the active Flutter UI and the corresponding visualization of the widget tree and the render tree. Thus, you can follow this mapping into the source and see where in the code (whether it is your code or the framework code) a widget is being created or configured. To open the tool, click **Flutter Inspector** on the right side of the main IDE window (or choose **View | Tool Windows | Flutter Inspector** on the main menu).

## Dart Analysis Tool Window
The **Dart Analysis** tool window allows you to monitor issues, such as potential problems and inconsistencies, that might arise during the project development. This functionality is provided by the **Dart Analysis Server**, a local server that is shipped as a part of the Dart SDK and that is responsible for code completion, navigation, syntax highlighting, etc. Additionally, the **Dart Analysis Server** provides the plugin framework, which permits the Flutter plugin to transfer its own sets of information, including warnings, messages, and code completions. To open this tool window, click **Dart Analysis** at the bottom of the main IDE window (or choose **View | Tool Windows | Dart Analysis** on the main menu).

## Run Tool Window
This tool window is standard for IntelliJ IDEA: it displays output that has been generated by your application. However, new plugins deliver a number of changes: **Flutter Hot Reload** and **Flutter Hot Restart** features and Dart-specific tools such as **Observatory**, which displays code coverage, examines the heap, and provides profiling, and **Timeline**, which captures the stack snapshot. The corresponding buttons have been added to this window. Also, you can open the **Flutter Inspector** from the **Run** tool window. To view your Flutter app's output, click **Run** at the bottom of the main IDE window (or choose **View | Tool Windows | Dart Analysis** on the main menu).
